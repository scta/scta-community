[The international image interoperability framework (IIIF)](http://scta.info) creates the potential for amazing trans-institutional collections and seamless users experiences that are the result of real time aggregation of data sets produces by institutions, librarians, and researchers scattered through the world.

While IIIF creates this potential, it is only actualized through the hard work of institutions to build the systems and infrastructures to deliver their content according to the stipulations of the IIIF specification.

In this post I want a great example of the actualization of this achievement and to acknowledge and thank the institutions that have made it possible.

Adam Wodeham's Ordinatio is an incredibly important text to the history of philosophy and theology. Today, efforts are underway to make that text available at every dimension of the editorial process, from critical edition, to diplomatic transcriptions, to easy consultation of manuscript images.

Until now, the four manuscripts of this text have been scattered throughout the world. To consult them, one needed to travel from Spain to France to Rome.

With the aid of IIIF and participating institutions, we have been able to bring all these of these witness together in a single viewer, to consult and compare side by side. Moreover, through the on-going efforts of the Scholastic Commentaries and Texts Archive we are able to bring alongside these images supplemental material such as navigation aids and diplomatic transcriptions to enhance the viewing experience.

Below is a screen shot of these four manuscripts brought together in the Mirador Viewer.

Leveraging the power of Linked Data, the SCTA is able to connect additional scholarly data to these images, detailed tables of contents and diplomatic transcriptions that enrich the viewing experience of these images.

Finally, using Linked Data Notifications and the Mirador LDN Plugin, institutions that make these images available, can allow their users to choose to import SCTA into their viewing experience.
