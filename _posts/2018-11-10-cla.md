## Contributor License Agreement

Data crawled and aggregated by the SCTA
is licensed under a Creative Commons License: [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

This means, as a contributor:
* You retain full rights to use and display this data forever.
  * As a contributor, this includes the right to expand the license and make it available, for example, for commercial use by particular parties.
  * End users are expected to always attribute the data you created to you and to share the data under the same conditions.
* You are also granting the public and the SCTA a permanent license to use, display, and build upon this data.
  * The CC license on material registered/crawled by SCTA cannot be revoked.
    * This means, the data once made freely and openly available remains permanently freely and openly available.
  * The above open license includes permission for others to make "further developed" editions.
    * This means that, as subsequent layers of work are added to the submitted data, the "editor" may be reclassified from "editor" to "general contributor". Such re-classification will always come with a pointer back to the version of the data in its submitted form in order to make easy comparisons which transparently show how the text has evolved. The SCTA version control system will ensure the contributor's name will forever be associated with the role indicated in the submitted version and that the raw data of this version will be accessible. 
    * Dependent upon how the progress of further editing and contributions, new contributors and editors maybe declared for the new version of the text. 
    * By granting this license which permits "further development" of the contributed data, the contributor is granting the SCTA community sole discretion over the attribution of the "further developed" texts that it chooses to aggregates. At the same time contributor retains the right to continue to attribute and distribute their own work however they see fit, but cannot dictate that it be aggregated by the SCTA or displayed by SCTA affiliate viewers.
