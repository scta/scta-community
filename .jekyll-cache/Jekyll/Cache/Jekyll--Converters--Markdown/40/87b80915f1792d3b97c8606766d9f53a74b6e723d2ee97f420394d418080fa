<p>Grossly simplified, the SCTA is a non-commercial, open access, community driven ‚Äúdata publisher‚Äù of medieval and modern texts from that scholastic tradition. By focusing on data publication rather than print or simple web publication, we help make machine actionable texts available so that text data can be linked together (via Linked data) and made available for free and open downstream publication in print or on the web in a plurality of forms. (One such downstream visual presentation can be found here https://scta.lombardpress.org).</p>

<p>A typical granted-funded partner (a ‚Äúsupporting contributor (group)‚Äù member) writes in a budget line for the SCTA membership as part of their grant proposal. The fee would vary depending on the size of the grant and the project. For a typical project, the fee might be somewhere between $1,000-$5,000 annually over the lifetime of the grant.</p>

<p>If a grant is successful, membership fees would be pooled by the SCTA with membership fees from other groups, and together these fees would be put toward the long term operational costs.</p>

<p>These membership costs should be viewed as similar to what a traditional publisher might charge as a ‚Äúsubvention‚Äù or ‚ÄúArticle Processing Charge‚Äù (APC) for open access publication. Since granting agencies like the ERC usually expect that research outputs are made available as ‚ÄúOpen Access‚Äù and publishers require APC charges for ‚ÄúOpen Access‚Äù, granting agencies generally understand these costs.</p>

<p>Long-term sustainability of DH projects is a perpetual problem form short-term funded grant projects. But with this approach the SCTA is offering a way to absorb a small percentage of grant money, and then, by pooling resources together with other grant funded projects, extending the reach of that money into the long-term future for the benefit of all projects, not just one.</p>
