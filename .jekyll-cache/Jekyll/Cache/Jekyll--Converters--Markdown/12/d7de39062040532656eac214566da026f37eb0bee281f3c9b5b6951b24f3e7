I")<p>There are lots of ways to contribute and help improve the SCTA corpus suited to contributors of various skill levels.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most obvious and common thing a casual contributor will want to do is simply fix an erroneous transcription.</p>

<p>The two main methods are direct correction or issue creation. In either case, users will need a github account.</p>

<p>To make a correction:</p>
<ol>
  <li>highlight a word, select “edit”,</li>
  <li>if necessary, follow github instructions to fork the relevant repo</li>
  <li>then make the correction to the underlying XML source text</li>
  <li>write a message about the change made</li>
  <li>then follow the github instructions to submit the pull request</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider the image example below:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lum-faculty-jcwitt-public/sctaLbpTextCorrection.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>If the correction is more involved and difficult to make directly to the source text, or if the problem needs more deliberation and consideration, you can create a github issue.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simply click on the “create GitHub issues” link</li>
  <li>Then in the issue, describe the problem and where in the text it occurs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider the image example below:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lum-faculty-jcwitt-public/sctaLbp_createIssue.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>These kinds of issues should be focused on the text as “data” (e.g. transcription corrections, text markup, text hierarchy corrections)</p>

<p>Presentational issues, application bugs, or application feature requests should be directed at the Web Application itself (the LombardPress-Web App) which displays text data. The <a href="https://github.com/lombardpress/lombardpress-webjs/issues">Lbp-Web App issues list can be found here</a></p>
