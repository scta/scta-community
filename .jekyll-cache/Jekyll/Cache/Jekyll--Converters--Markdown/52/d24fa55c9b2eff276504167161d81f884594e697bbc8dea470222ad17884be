I"”<p>If you want to transcribe a text that can be aggregated by the SCTA,
you need to follow some basic rules.</p>

<h2 id="1-first-you-need-to-fork-the-corresponding-scta-text-directory">1. First you need to fork the corresponding SCTA Text Directory</h2>

<p>A list of SCTA text directories can be found at <a href="http://github.com/scta-texts">http://github.com/scta-texts</a></p>

<p>If you‚Äôre not familiar with GIT, you can use the TEI-WEB-EDITOR <a href="https://tei-web-editor.herokuapp.com/">https://tei-web-editor.herokuapp.com/</a> to simplify things. Log in with your github credentials. Click the Open icon, and add the url of the repo you want to fork in the filed titled, ‚ÄúFork another repository‚Äù.</p>

<h2 id="2-second-you-need-to-understand-the-structure-of-an-scta-directory">2. Second, you need to understand the structure of an SCTA directory.</h2>

<p>Each sub-directory in a text repo corresponds to a resource in the SCTA database.
The resource can be dereferenced at http://scta.info/resource/<resource_short_id>.
The `resource_short_id` corresponds to the name of the subdirectory.</resource_short_id></p>

<p>Each sub-directory / resource refers to a smaller section of the larger text.</p>

<p>Find the section of the text your interested in and open that sub-directory.</p>

<h2 id="3-third-create-a-properly-named-file">3. Third, create a properly named file.</h2>

<p>Each resource can have several transcriptions: diplomatic transcriptions of different witnesses, translations transcriptions, and critical transcriptions.</p>

<p>The default canonical transcription will have the same name as the sub-directory in which it lives.</p>

<p>So if you‚Äôve forked a repo, and you want to add the first transcription to a sub-folder titled ‚Äúquestion1‚Äù, you should make a file called question1.xml.</p>

<p>If you want to make a diplomatic transcription of a particular witness, you can make a file with the slug of the witness as a prefix. For example, ‚Äúclm26711_question1.xml‚Äù.</p>

<p>These are simply the default file name patterns. All of them can be over-written
in a separate file called a ‚Äútranscriptions.xml‚Äù file. (We‚Äôll be adding another article about the transcriptions file later.)</p>

<h2 id="4-fourth-start-transcribing-follow-the-lombardpress-schema-guidelines">4. Fourth, start transcribing follow the LombardPress-Schema Guidelines</h2>

<p>See <a href="http://lombardpress.org/schema/docs/">http://lombardpress.org/schema/docs/</a></p>

<p>In many cases, a file called template.xml will already be populated in each sub-directory. Use this file as a template to get started, but make sure to rename it properly as stated above.</p>

<h2 id="5-submit-a-pull-request-at-any-time">5. Submit a pull request at any time.</h2>

<p>At any time you can submit a pull request for your transcription to be approved by the SCTA community and aggregated by the SCTA crawler.</p>

<p>Again, if you‚Äôre using the TEI Web Editor <a href="https://tei-web-editor.herokuapp.com">https://tei-web-editor.herokuapp.com</a>, you can simply hit the pull-request icon and submit your changes directly to github.</p>
